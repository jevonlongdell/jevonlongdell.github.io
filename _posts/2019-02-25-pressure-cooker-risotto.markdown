This recipie is slightly modified from one in a book that came with my pressure cooker. It cites [www.hippressurecooking.com](http://www.hippressurecooking.com) as the source. Nice quick way to cook the starch part of dinner if you don't mind having to clean the pressure cooker afterward.


# Ingredients:

*    1 cup of rice
*    1 cup of quinoa
*    Â½ masel stock cube
*    1 onion chopped
*    1 swig white wine
*    olive oil
*    pepper to taste


# Directions:

1. Soften the onion in the pressure cooker.

2. Add rice and toast lightly. Wait till a couple of grains have turned golden brown.

3. Add swig of wine and stir until it has all evapourated.

4. Add four cups of water, the quinoa and the stock. 

5. Close it up. Bring it up to pressure and cook for 8 min.
