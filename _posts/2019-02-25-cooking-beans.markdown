This page is to record my lessons and observations from cooking beans in the pressure cooker. Because you can't see what is going on inside the pot, it is worth being a bit quantitative.

I will add things 

# Lessons

1. Don't cook beans in the pressure cooker in a tomato sauce. It takes for ever! More than twice as long as in water. Apparently it's due to the acid in the tomatoes. Whatever the cause a one pot, one step, beans in tomato sauce isn't reall practicable. 

# Observations
1. After soaking for a day in what started off as boiling water kiddney beans were well cooked, but not over cooked, after 20 min in the pressure cooker.
