When there is zuchini in the garden, sometime one misses getting picked. This is the first recipie that I have found that makes marrow taste good!

It's from [Hari Ghotra](https://www.harighotra.co.uk/marrow-curry-recipe)

# Ingredients:

*    1 tbsp rapeseed oil
*    1 tsp cumin seeds
*    1 tsp mustard seeds
*    1 large onion, peeled and chopped
*    2-3 garlic cloves, peeled
*    200g tin plum tomatoes
*    1 tbsp of fresh ginger, grated
*    1-2 green chillies, chopped 
*    ½ tsp turmeric
*    ½ tsp chilli powder
*    1 tsp salt
*    1 large marrow (approx 1-1.5kg)
*    1 tsp garam masala
*    handful fresh coriander


# Method:

1. Heat oil and add the cumin and mustard seeds. Once they sizzle and become fragrant add the onions. Fry for about 6-7 minutes until they become translucent and just golden brown.

2. Add the garlic and cook on a gentle heat for a few minutes. In the meantime, wash and chop the marrow into 3-4cm chunks. If your marrow is an older marrow then you may also need to peel it as the skin can be tough. You may also need to remove the seeds and soft central part of the marrow. 

3. Add the tomatoes to the pan and stir in the grated ginger, chilli powder, turmeric, salt, and green chilli. Stir for a few minutes until the masala in thick and shiny.

4. Add the chopped marrow and bring the pan to a simmer. Cover, then turn the heat to low and cook for about 20-30 minutes. Do check and stir occasionally.

5. When the marrow has cooked to the texture you like, remove from the heat and add the garam masala and coriander to serve.

# Notes:

This turned out really good, I basically followed the recipie but:
 - Used a whole tin of tomatoes
 - Used chipotle powder in place of chillie powder and chilies. It is what I had and I like it
 - Used fresh tumeric.
 - Next time would chop up the marrow a bit smaller maybe 10mm cubes.
